Considering doing a Camera idea for the project. Interactables are Camera and Polaroid picture print out. Player picks up camera and uses a thumb button to take a picture, which dispenses a polaroid.

## VR Lab Project: Turn in
I originally had something more complicated in mind but had to fall back to finding the handle for the well, putting it on and turning it. I was attempting to learn how to do more complicated things with the event functions and I think the spawning and despawnin of the handle turned out well. However, I couldn't seem to get the handle turning events to fire properly and wish I had more time to look into it further. I created a duplicate handle and hide the default one at the well. The "hidden" handle is up against the garage door.
